Repo for my *DJames* Android App & vocal assistant. ðŸ¤– *NOTE: the app is currently intended to be used only by a closed group of authorized testers (close friends).*

DJames is a vocal Spotify remote & smart driving assistant for Android. It makes use of *Google Dialogflow* for Speech-to-Text and basic NLP, *Spotify's Web API* and custom NLP extraction and matching algorithms. The UI is based on Jetpack Compose.

Soon to be integrated:
* LLM conversations for information retrieval, using LangChain & Groq (currently under POC tests).
